# DarkCSS

DarkCSS is an alternitive with easy to read syntax for those who _dont't_ like css or sass. It's super simple, to learn and use.

To get started for the tutorial, please do the following in the terminal:

```
npm i -g darkcss
```
Now when you run `darkcss`, you'll be able to use darkcss! 

If it doesn't work, put npx in front of darkcss and it should work!

Now let's move on!
