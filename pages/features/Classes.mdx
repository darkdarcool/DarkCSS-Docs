# DarkCSS classes


Classes are important in css, because you can specify the element, and in DarkCSS, it is supported! Say you did:

```
.h1 {
  content.color = red;
}
```
The out would be:

```
.h1 {
  color: red;
}
```
While this class is short, your's can be long and complex and stress out our compiler!
